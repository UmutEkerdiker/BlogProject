### BlogProject
A blog app connected with MongoDB using Mongoose. Made in June 2022.

I've used EJS for templates and partials.
A new blog post can be submitted via /compose route.
Posts are limited to 100 characters on the homepage. Can be viewed fully by clicking "Read More" on a seperate page.
UI will be improved in the future and app will be hosted on Heroku.
